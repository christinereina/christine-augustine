      <p>I started in web design by customizing my Myspace profile with Harry Potter. Much much later, I continued pursuing web design in college were I earned my Multimedia degree. I built my very first site from scratch in Dreamweaver. However, I mainly focused on my video and photo editing skills. After several years of working in TV production and various customer support roles, I am now in a coding bootcamp coding almost everyday.<p>
